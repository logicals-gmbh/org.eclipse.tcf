        <td width=500>TCF communication model is based on the idea of services.
        A service is a group of related commands, events and semantics.
        New services are expected to be defined by developers of tools and target agents.
        To achieve certain level of compatibility of tools/targets TCF inclides definitions
        of common services
    <tr>
        <td><a href='TCF Context Identifier Explanation.html'>TCF Context Identifier Explanation</a>
        <td width=500>Most if not all TCF services functions need some way to identify what entity e.g. process,
        thread, task, device on JTAG scan chain, etc they should operate on.
        To do this TCF uses a context identifier (aka ContextId). This document is attempting to explain how
        ContextIds are intended to be used
