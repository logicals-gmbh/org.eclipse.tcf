<h1><a name='Overview'>Overview</a></h1>

<p>Today almost every device software development tool on the market has its own method
of communication with target system. Communication methods often require individual setup,
configuration and maintenance, and impose unnecessary limitations.
The goal of the Target Communication Framework is to establish a common ground in
the area of communication protocols between development tools and embedded devices.</p>

<p>The goal is a single protocol used to communicate between all tools and targets:</p>
<p><img src='TCF Specification Image1.png'></p>

<h2><a name='Goals'>Goals</a></h2>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>A universal, simple, lightweight, vendor agnostic framework for tools and targets
    to communicate for the purpose of debugging, profiling, code patching and other device
    software development needs.

    <li>A single configuration per target (not per tool per target as today in most cases),
    or no configuration when possible.

    <li>Minimal overhead and footprint on the target side.
</ul>

<h2><a name='Definitions'>Definitions</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>Peer:</b> <dd>a communication endpoint. Both hosts and targets are called peers. A
peer can act as a client or a server depending on the services it implements.

<dt><b>Service:</b> <dd>a group of related commands, events and their semantics define a service.
A service can be discovered, added or removed as a group at a communication endpoint.

<dt><b>Message:</b> <dd>a packet of data, formatted according to the framework specification
and transmitted over a communication channel.

<dt><b>Channel:</b> <dd>a communication link connecting two endpoints (peers).  A single
channel may be used to communicate with multiple services.  Multiple channels may
be used to connect the same peers, however no command or event ordering is guaranteed
across channels.

<dt><b>Command:</b> <dd>a message sent to a remote peer in order to request some
predefined action there.

<dt><b>Result:</b> <dd>a message sent as a response to a command.

<dt><b>Event:</b> <dd>a message sent to all interested parties in order to notify
them about state changes.
</dl>

<h2><a name='Requirements'>Requirements</a></h2>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>A simple and extensible protocol.

    <li>Small footprint on the target.

    <li>Fully asynchronous, message based communication.

    <li>Two ways of message routing:

    <ul>
        <li>Point to point request/response (command/result) communication.

        <li>Subscription based broadcast of notifications (events).
    </ul>

    <li>Full duplex, symmetric communication: both host and target should be able to send
    commands and events at same time, though ability to establish a communication channel
    can be limited to host only.

    <li>For each communication channel between two peers, the framework should preserve
    the order of commands, results and events.

    <li>Support for slow and high latency connections.

    <li>Transport protocol agnostic. The framework should work well, at least, on top
    of: TCP/IP, UDP, USB, RS232 and JTAG.

    <li>The framework should support multiplexing, that is, single target device shared
    between multiple tools at same time. To reduce footprint on the target, multiplexing
    can be implemented on the host if needed.

    <li>Dynamic discovery of participating targets and hosts. No configuration when possible.

    <li>Dynamic discovery of available services (high level protocols, command sets).
    Clients can query for available services.

    <li>Services can be added and removed dynamically.

    <li>The framework should define a set of common high level interfaces (services).  For
    example: flow control, memory access, registers access, up-load mechanism, kernel
    awareness, run control, target file system, console, flash programming. Implementation
    of these interfaces is optional, but if provided it will support much wider compatibility
    with various tools.

    <li>The framework should be layered in such a way so it is possible to use different transport
    medias (e.g. TCP/IP, RS232, USB, etc) without any changes to individual services.
    In other words, transport implementation should be services agnostic, and services
    implementation should be transport agnostic.

    <li>Each service defines how marshalling is done for command, result and event arguments.
    This allows existing target agents to remain unchanged.

    <li>The framework should define a preferred marshalling mechanism that new services can
    use.

    <li>The definition of services (groups of related commands and events) is separate
    from the definition of the framework itself.  The framework provides unified communication
    mechanism, while services use it to communicate with its clients.

    <li>Anybody (including 3rd parties) can add services without having to modify the
    communication protocol or framework software.

    <li>The framework should support tunneling through a proxy. Proxy may be used, for
    example:

    <ul type='circle'>
        <li>to bridge different transport protocols, like TCP and RS232;

        <li>to make a RS232 or USB target connection accessible from multiple hosts;

        <li>to access targets behind firewalls or otherwise not directly accessible
    </ul>

    <li>A proxy should be able to provide services in addition to those implemented by
    a target. Such distribution of services allows target services to be implemented on
    a host, thereby reducing the footprint on the target. For example, debug information,
    stack back trace or OS awareness can be implemented by a proxy on a host. To provide
    this functionality, proxy services would typically use low-level target services,
    like memory access.

    <li>Support of concurrent requests. Maximum number of concurrent requests (window
    size) can be limited on target side. Simple agents only have to support window size
    of 1. Framework should maintain a queue of additional requests, so tools don't need
    to know the window size. This may only be relevant for certain transport protocols
    e.g. UDP.

    <li>Events can be broadcasted at any time, i.e. no polling should be required.

    <li>The protocol should support a standard mechanism of sending data larger than MTU.

    <li>Format of the protocol messages is defined by syntax rules, see
    <a href='TCF Syntax Rules Notation.html'>Syntax Rules Notation</a>.
</ul>

<h1><a name='Design'>Framework Software Design Considerations</a></h1>

<p>The framework will be packaged, distributed and installed on a host as separate
product. It should be installed as system service and require no configuration for
most common case &ndash; target connected over TCP or UDP on a local network. For more complicated
setup, framework should have easily accessible and user friendly GUI with all relevant
configuration options.</p>

<p>The framework should use a dynamic discovery protocol to locate targets and other hosts
running instances of the framework when possible, and maintain a dynamic list of available
communication endpoints, as well as lists of services available at each endpoint.
Host discovery is needed to locate hosts able to proxy communications for targets,
which are not accessible otherwise - for example, targets connected with RS232 or
JTAG to a remote host. It should also be possible to add target configuration manually.
Development tools will access this data through the Locator Service API and use it,
for example, to present a user a list of available targets that have capabilities
needed by a particular tool.</p>

<p>The framework should provide software libraries to be used by tools and target agents
developers. The libraries should be available at least for ANSI C and Java. On the host
side, at least Windows, Solaris and Linux must be supported. Libraries will provide
APIs for low-level communication protocol, Locator Service, preferred marshaling and
predefined common services.</p>

<p>The proposed target communication protocol is text-based. It allows extensions,
which define messages with blocks of binary data, but it is not a recommended data
formatting, and its usage is supposed to be limited. Text-based protocols have both
advantages and disadvantages in compare with binary protocols.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>The software for text-based protocols is easier to develop and debug since they
    use a relatively human-friendly communication.

    <li>It is possible to use huge selection of existing tools and library routines to
    view, edit, validate, and transform text-based data.

    <li>Text based definition is in line with current trend in Internet protocols: most
    popular protocols such as SMTP and HTTP are text-based.
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>Text-based protocols usually need more bytes to store numerical data than binary
    protocols do.

    <li>Parsing of text-based data is not efficient compared to parsing of binary data
    since text-based data is usually not stored in a way similar to how it is stored in
    computer memory.

    <li>It is seldom possible to read only part of a text-based message since the exact
    byte offset to a data item is generally not known.
</ul>

<p>A possible alternative to consider is binary, variable length encoding like BaseStream.</p>

<h2><a name='Concurrency'>Concurrency</a></h2>

<p>Concurrent asynchronous communication is much faster then synchronous, because
it alleviates communication channel latency and allows better bandwidth utilization.
But it also requires proper design of framework software. Concurrency, in general,
implies multithreading. However, systems developed with global multithreading, are
often unreliable and prone to different kinds of thread synchronization problems,
which are often very difficult to locate and resolve. We therefore strongly recommend
that the software is designed to follow the compartment threading model, which simplifies
thread synchronization and promotes reliable software design. In this model each thread
execution path is strictly contained in predefined subset of code (compartment), and
no code, except for reentrant libraries, is executed by multiple threads. Each compartment
has a message queue and other threads communicate with the compartment thread by posting
messages to the queue.</p>

<p>The framework APIs are designed to be compatible with the compartment threading model.
Hence the API functions do not contain any thread synchronization primitives to protect
against multiple threads using the functions. All framework APIs belong to a single
compartment and should be used by a single thread. The same thread is used to dispatch
events and command results. Concurrency is achieved by declaring API functions to
be asynchronous. Asynchronous functions do not have any return value, and returns
immediately, most of the time before the intended job is done. They take additional
arguments to specify a callback function and callback data. In object-oriented languages
such as Java, this is typically done by a single callback object argument containing
both the data and the function.  The result listener is called asynchronously when
the job is done. This approach is commonly known as asynchronous<b>, </b>event-driven<b>
</b>or<b> </b>callback-based<b> </b>programming<b>.</b></p>

<p>One important characteristic of an asynchronous code is that the methods defined
by the user will often be called from within the framework itself, rather than from
the user's application code. The framework often plays the role of the main program
in coordinating and sequencing application activity. This phenomenon is called Inversion
of Control (also known as the Hollywood Principle - &ldquo;Don't call us, we'll call you&rdquo;).</p>

<h2><a name='Reflection'>Reflection</a></h2>

<p>Communication between development tools and embedded devices must allow a host
to collect target side data and build a reflection of target state. Reflection is
usually incomplete &ndash; a subset of all remote data. Reflection is always delayed &ndash; it
represents a remote peer state in the past. Reflection can be updated by polling for
data changes or by listening to events (event is communication message that is sent
asynchronously by a peer to notify others about state change). Reflection is correct
if it represents a state that actually did happen on remote peer.</p>

<p>Reflection is coherent if it is exactly equal to a subset of the peer state at a single
moment of time and that moment of time is not too far in the past. Non-coherent reflection
can have parts of data representing peer state at different moments of time. Coherent
reflection is more valuable for a user, because non-coherent reflection can have logically
conflicting data if that data was collected at different time.</p>

<p>Traditionally, debuggers would ensure coherence of state reflection by collecting
data only while target is suspended, and flushing all (or most) reflection data (reducing
observed subset to zero) when target is resumed. This approach does not work well
for multithreaded, multicore or real time targets. Maintaining correctness and coherence
of a non-empty reflection while target is running requires additional support from
target agent, communication software and debugger itself.</p>

<p>Since remote peer state is changing over time, coherent reflection can be built
only if:</p>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>The observed subset of state is properly selected and dynamically re-selected. Observing
    too much can overflow communication channel. Observing too little has little value
    for a user.

    <li>The observer is listening to all relevant events.

    <li>Events are coming in exactly same order as corresponding changes happen.

    <li>Events are properly ordered relative to other messages that carry state data.

    <li>All changes in observed subset of peer state are reported by events.

    <li>All event messages must either contain a complete description of a change or they
    all should not contain any state data at all. If client is getting some data from
    events and required to retrieve new values of other changed data by using other means
    (commands), the reflection will not be coherent at least until such retrieval is complete.
    And if such periods of data retrieval overlap, the reflection will never be coherent.
    Sending deltas with events is usually more efficient then using data retrieval commands
    to update reflection.
</ul>

<h2><a name='Ordering'>Message ordering</a></h2>

<p>The transmission order of commands, results and events is important, it conveys
valuable information about target state transitions and it should be preserved when
possible. Consider an example:</p>

<p>Client transmits: </p>

<pre>
    Command X=2
</pre>

<p>Then, as result of some activity of another client or the target itself, X is assigned
value 3.</p>

<p>Target transmits:</p>

<pre>
    Event X=3
    Result X=2
</pre>

<p>Now the client has to show the value of X to a user. If the order of messages is preserved,
the client will know that command was executed <i>after</i> X was assigned 3, the
last message contains the last known value of X and 2 is the correct value to show. If
the target is allowed to transmit events and results in arbitrary order, the client
will have no clue what to show &ndash; 2 or 3. In fact, the client will have to make a tough
decision about each message it receives: either trust the message data as the correct last
known target state, or assume the message came in out-of-order and ignore it, or re-request
the information from the target.</p>

<p>Note that re-requesting data from the target, in general, does not solve the problem
of interpretation of messages when order is not preserved. For example, after sending
a request to read value of X, X could change at about the same time, and client could
receive:</p>

<pre>
    Event X=2
    Result X=3
    Event X=4
</pre>

<p>If order is not preserved, it is still impossible to tell which value of X is the
last one. A client could assume value of X unknown every time it receives a notification
of X change, and then re-request the data again. But this is expensive and, if events
coming in frequently, client can end up in infinite loop re-requesting the data again
and again, and it will never have trustworthy data about current target state.</p>

<p>Developers should be careful when using multithreading or multiple queues in software
design &ndash; it can easily cause message reordering.</p>

<p>The framework itself is required to preserve message order. However, if for whatever
reason a target agent cannot preserve message order, the result will be that clients
of the service can receive messages in the wrong order. When this is the case it should
be well documented, so tools developers are aware and can make the best of the situation.
In most cases it will not cause any trouble, but there is no perfect way to restore
the actual sequence of events and maintain data coherency after ordering was lost, and
in some cases it can severely impact tool functionality and user experience.</p>

<h1><a name='Transport'>Transport Layer</a></h1>


<p>Tools are required to be transport protocol agnostic, so most of the layer functionality
is used internally by framework and is not exposed to clients. This layer maintains
a collection of transport protocol handlers. Each handler is designed to provide:</p>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>Enumeration of available peers, including both automatically discovered and manually
    configured peers. The handler fires notification events when peers are added or removed.
    Enumeration can be implemented by scanning JTAG chain, by broadcasting special UDP
    packet and waiting for responses, by communicating with ICE hardware, or by any other
    suitable means.

    <li>Bidirectional point-to-point communication of data packets. Packets are byte arrays
    of arbitrary size.
    The transport handler and the underlying protocol are responsible for adding all necessary
    control data, headers, error checking bits, addresses, fragmentation/defragmentation,
    flow control, transmission retries and whatever necessary to ensure lossless, order-preserving
    delivery of packets.

    <li>Thr configuration UI should allow user to inspect and modify properties of both manually
    configured and automatically discovered peers, setup new peers, view connections status
    and statistics.
</ul>

<p>Existing service discovery protocols can be used together with the framework, for
example:</p>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>Zero Configuration Networking (Zeroconf), see <a href='http://www.zeroconf.org/'>http://www.zeroconf.org</a>;

    <li>Service Location Protocol (SLP), developed by the IETF;

    <li>Jini, which is Sun's Java-base approach to service discovery, see <a href='http://www.sun.com/jini'>http://www.sun.com/jini</a>;

    <li>Salutation, developed by an open industry consortium, called the Salutation Consortium;

    <li>Microsoft's Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), see <a href='http://www.upnp.org/'>http://www.upnp.org</a>;

    <li>Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP).
</ul>

<p>Service discovery protocols, as well as transport protocols, will be supported by
framework plug-ins, they are not part of the framework code itself, and they can be developed
by 3rd parties. Note that existing discovery protocols define term &ldquo;service&rdquo; differently
- as an independent communication endpoint (usually a TCP/IP port). In this document
it is called &ldquo;peer&rdquo; (host, target, communication endpoint), and a peer can provide
multiple services over single communication channel.</p>

<p>Use of standard discovery protocols should be optional, because it can potentially
cause conflict or interference between development tools and application being developed
over a use of same standard protocol &ndash; device software often includes implementation
of service discovery protocols as part of the application code to support their main functions.
</p>

<h1><a name='Protocol'>Communication Protocol</a></h1>

<p>The communication protocol defines data packet properties and roles common for
all services. The communication protocol API provides functions for opening and closing
the communication channel for a particular peer, and for sending and receiving
data packets. The protocol defines contents of a part of a packet, the rest of the
packet is treated as array of bytes at this level. The communication protocol implementation
also provides:</p>

<ul type='disc'>
    <li>Multiplexing &ndash; opening multiple channels per peer.

    <li>Proxy &ndash; packet forwarding in behalf of other hosts.
</ul>

<p>The protocol defines three packet types: commands (requests), results (responses),
and events. Each packet consists of several protocol defined control fields followed
by a byte array of data. Binary representation of control fields is a sequence of
zero-terminated ASCII strings. The format of the data depends on the service. We recommend
using the framework preferred marshaling for data formatting.</p>

<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;message&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;command&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;result&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;event&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;flow control message&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<h2><a name='ProtocolCommands'>Commands</a></h2>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;command&gt;</i>
    &rArr; C &bull; <i>&lt;token&gt; </i>&bull; <i>&lt;service name&gt; </i>&bull; <i>&lt;command name&gt; </i>&bull; <i>&lt;byte array: arguments&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>Command packets start with the string &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;token&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;chars&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>A token is a unique string generated by the framework for each command. It is used to match
results to commands.</p>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;service name&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;chars&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>A service name is used to identify a service that handles the command. It is the same
string as that returned by Service.getName().</p>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;command name&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;chars&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>The interpretation of the command name depends on the service.</p>

<p>A command should always be answered with result packed. The result does not have to
be positive &ndash; it can include an error code, or it can be special "N" result that indicates that command was not recognized,
but there always must be one. Since the client
cannot detect that a response is missing, if for some reason the peer is not able to
answer a command, it should consider such situation a fatal communication error and
it must shutdown the communication channel. It is not necessary to wait for a result
before sending the next command. In fact, sending multiple commands in a burst can greatly
improve performance, especially when the connection has a high latency. At the same time,
clients should be carefully designed to avoid flooding the communication channel with
unlimited number of requests, since this will use resources in forms of memory to
store the requests and time to process them.</p>

<h2><a name='ProtocolResults'>Results</a></h2>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;result&gt;</i>
    &rArr; N &bull; <i>&lt;token&gt;</i> &bull;
    &rArr; R &bull; <i>&lt;token&gt;</i> &bull; <i>&lt;byte array: result data&gt;</i>
    &rArr; P &bull; <i>&lt;token&gt;</i> &bull; <i>&lt;byte array: progress data&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>Result packets start with the string &ldquo;P&rdquo; for intermediate result, &ldquo;R&rdquo; for final
result, and &ldquo;N&rdquo; if the command is not recognized. Receiving a &ldquo;R&rdquo; or &ldquo;N&rdquo; result concludes execution of corresponding command.
There should be exactly one &ldquo;R&rdquo; or &ldquo;N&rdquo; result for each command. In addition, command execution can produce any number of
intermediate &ldquo;P&rdquo; results. &ldquo;P&rdquo; results can be sent before &ldquo;R&rdquo;, and it can serve, for
example, as command execution progress report when execution takes long time.</p>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;token&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;chars&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>The token should match the token field of one of the pending commands that produced the result.</p>

<h2><a name='ProtocolEvents'>Events</a></h2>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;event&gt;</i>
    &rArr; E &bull; <i>&lt;service name&gt;</i> &bull; <i>&lt;event name&gt;</i> &bull; <i>&lt;byte array: event data&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>Event packets start with string &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</p>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;service name&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;chars&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>The service name identifies the service that fired the event. It is the same
string as that returned by Service.getName().</p>

<pre><b><font face="Courier New" size=2 color=#333399>
<i>&lt;event name&gt;</i>
    &rArr; <i>&lt;chars&gt;</i>
</font></b></pre>

<p>The interpretation of the event name depends on the service.</p>

<p>Events are used to notify clients about changes in peer state. Services should
provide sufficient variety of events for clients to track remote peer state without
too much of polling. Clients, interested in a particular aspect of the target state,
should have a &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; (or &ldquo;model&rdquo;) of that state and update the reflection by
listening for relevant events. If a service implements a command that changes a particular
aspect of peers state, then, normally, it should also generate notification events
when that same part of the state changes and it should provide a command to retrieve
the current value of the state &ndash; to be used by clients to initialize the reflection. Service
events are defined statically, together with commands. The framework does not do any
event processing besides delivering them to clients, however a service can define
additional event-related functionality if necessary, for example commands for event
filtering, enabling, disabling, registration, etc. Care should be taken when designing
events for a service &ndash; if events are sent too frequently, they will cause flooding
of the communication channels and degrade performance. However, too few events will
force clients to poll for changes and can also degrade performance. A balanced approach
is the best.</p>

<h2><a name='ProtocolFlowControl'>Flow Control</a> </h2>

<p>It often happens that one side of communication channel produces messages faster
then they can be transmitted over the channel or can be consumed by another side.
This will cause channel traffic congestion (flooding). The framework will deal with the
problem and slow down transmitting side by blocking execution inside sendEvent(),
sendCommand() and sendResult() functions when message buffers are full. However, in
many cases, it is not the best way to handle congestion. For example, it can make
a tool UI appear locked for prolonged time or it can break target software if it is
designed to work in real time. Clients can use flow control events to implement advanced
techniques to handle traffic congestion, for example, message coalescing, switching
to less detailed messages, etc.</p>

<i>&lt;flow control message&gt;</i>
    &rArr; F &bull; <i>&lt;int: traffic congestion level&gt;</i> &bull;
</font></b></pre>

<p>The traffic congestion level value is in the range -100..100, where -100 means no pending
messages (no traffic), 0 means optimal load, and positive numbers
indicate level of congestion. When a peer receives flow control message with congestion level > 0
it should try to reduce its transmition speed.</p>

<h1><a name='JSON'>Preferred Marshaling</a></h1>

<p>The TCF message data format is service specific. Since service specifications are
separate from the protocol specification, a service designer can choose any data format that
suits the service requirements best. However, to promote better compatibility and to
simplify service design and implementation, we recommend using <a href='TCF JSON.html'>JSON</a> for data formatting.</p>

<h1><a name='Locator'>Locator Service</a></h1>
