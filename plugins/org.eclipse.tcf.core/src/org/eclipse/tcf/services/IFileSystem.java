/**
 * File System service provides file transfer (and more generally file
 * system access) functionality in TCF. The service design is
 * derived from SSH File Transfer Protocol specifications.
 *
 *      Request Synchronization and Reordering
 *
 * The protocol and implementations MUST process requests relating to
 * the same file in the order in which they are received.  In other
 * words, if an application submits multiple requests to the server, the
 * results in the responses will be the same as if it had sent the
 * requests one at a time and waited for the response in each case.  For
 * example, the server may process non-overlapping read/write requests
 * to the same file in parallel, but overlapping reads and writes cannot
 * be reordered or parallelized.  However, there are no ordering
 * restrictions on the server for processing requests from two different
 * file transfer connections.  The server may interleave and parallelize
 * them at will.
 *
 * There are no restrictions on the order in which responses to
 * outstanding requests are delivered to the client, except that the
 * server must ensure fairness in the sense that processing of no
 * request will be indefinitely delayed even if the client is sending
 * other requests so that there are multiple outstanding requests all
 * the time.
 *
 * There is no limit on the number of outstanding (non-acknowledged)
 * requests that the client may send to the server.  In practice this is
 * limited by the buffering available on the data stream and the queuing
 * performed by the server.  If the server's queues are full, it should
 * not read any more data from the stream, and flow control will prevent
 * the client from sending more requests.
 *
 *      File Names
 *
 * This protocol represents file names as strings.  File names are
 * assumed to use the slash ('/') character as a directory separator.
 *
 * File names starting with a slash are "absolute", and are relative to
 * the root of the file system.  Names starting with any other character
 * are relative to the user's default directory (home directory). Client
 * can use 'user()' command to retrieve current user home directory.
 *
 * Servers SHOULD interpret a path name component ".." as referring to
 * the parent directory, and "." as referring to the current directory.
 * If the server implementation limits access to certain parts of the
 * file system, it must be extra careful in parsing file names when
 * enforcing such restrictions.  There have been numerous reported
 * security bugs where a ".." in a path name has allowed access outside
 * the intended area.
 *
 * An empty path name is valid, and it refers to the user's default
 * directory (usually the user's home directory).
 *
 * Otherwise, no syntax is defined for file names by this specification.
 * Clients should not make any other assumptions; however, they can
 * splice path name components returned by readdir() together
 * using a slash ('/') as the separator, and that will work as expected.
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
